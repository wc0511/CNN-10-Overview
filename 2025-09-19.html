    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, single-page vertical scrolling application was chosen for its intuitive user flow. It starts with a high-level overview of the news topics, allowing users to grasp the main points quickly. It then progressively deepens the content with interactive sections for Vocabulary, Sentence Analysis, and Further Reading. This structure supports both linear learning (scrolling through) and topic-based exploration (using the sticky navigation). Key interactions like flashcards and clickable sentence tips are designed to make learning active rather than passive, which is ideal for the target user (an English learner). -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Teen social media usage data ("nearly half... almost constantly"). Goal: Compare a proportion. Viz/Method: Doughnut Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Tooltip on hover. Justification: A chart provides a much stronger visual impact for statistical data than plain text, making the information more memorable.
        - Report Info: Vocabulary list. Goal: Organize for memorization. Viz/Method: Interactive Flashcards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click to flip. Justification: This transforms a passive list into an active learning tool, mimicking a proven study method.
        - Report Info: Challenging sentences. Goal: Organize and explain complex grammar. Viz/Method: Annotated Text (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click on highlighted phrases to reveal tips. Justification: This provides contextual, on-demand explanations without cluttering the initial view.
        - All other textual content from the report is organized into styled cards and sections for readability.
